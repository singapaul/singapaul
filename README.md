Hi there üëã I'm Paul. After graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering I soon started a career in manufacuting and supply chain management. Whilst I loved the rush of operations I missed the problem solving and technical challenge of Engineering, I also saw the fantastic possibilities for how technology was quickly changing our world and uncovered a passion for design üé®.

So in January 2022 I took the jump ü™Ç and joined the _nology.io consultancy programme as a junior full stack software developer and have loved every minute of it.
